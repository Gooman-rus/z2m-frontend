# Installation and usage
1. Check Mosquitto Broker logs right after a startup. You should be able to determine a websocket port in this log entry:
```
Opening websockets listen socket on port 1884
```

2. Download the latest [release](https://github.com/nurikk/z2m-frontend/releases) zip archive. Unzip it. Open file `index.html` in the browser.
3. Navigate to the `Settings` tab and fill all the options. Make sure you use **websocket** port from the step 1 in the mqtt server address.
4. Press `Submit` button and then refresh the page.
5. Navigate to the `Home` tab. You should be able to see the list of your devices.
6. Navigate to the `Map` tab and press button `Requests` in order to draw a map of your ZigBee network. After a couple of seconds the map should appear automatically. 
Remember that the map will be erased after refreshing the browsers page.
